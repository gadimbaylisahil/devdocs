### Common Mistakes

- Not treating currency as a separate asset
- Mixing up corporation names that are similar -- such as parent company. E.g, Mitsubishi vs Mitsubishi Motors

Measuring cheapness/value/price of the index is done with P/E ratio. Price/Earnings of the company. Thus, the index may actually be "cheap" while increasing.

### Conclusions

- Select the firm carefully based on correct name and treat the currency it is quoted in as a separete investment decision
- A bottom in the market may actually be more expensieve than a peak or vice versa

### Investment Management in a Nutshell

Possible risks:

- Country Risk
- Market Risk
- Currency Risk
- Liquidity Risk => When market capitalization is low and its exit time
- Inflation Risk
- Shortfall Risk

Some questions to go over with yourself:

- What kind of investor are you? Passive -- active?
- Looking for solid or rapid capital appreciation?
- Are you managing this yourself or hiring somebody for it?

Strategic Asset Allocation:

- Macro Picture
- Market volatility
- Market Valuation

### Role of financial markets

Participants:

- Firms
- Investors
- Government
- Financial Intermediaries(chain of brokers, institutions, exchanges)

### Several ways of managing risk

- By diversifying their investments, investors reduce the overall risk of their portfolio. 
- By purchasing derivative products, investors can hedge their portfolio against particular events.
- Through securitization, one combines different financial assets and sells parts of this combination(some parts bearing more risk than others) to different investors, thereby transferring them the risks of the initial assets.

### Basic Concepts of Finance

Focus on average returns as well -- not only on latest returns.

Higher return is good but risk matters.

There is a tradeoff between average return and risk.

The higher the average return compared to the risk -- the better.

*Return Risk Ratio*

Average return over X amount of time: 4%
Average risk over X amount of time: 10%

return-risk ratio = 4/10 = 0.4 = 40%

> The higher the return-risk ratio - the better(in isolation, however, you should also be aware of the possible losses in events of the occurrence of the risk events)

#### Relative Frequency of returns (Histogram)

Q: You have a sample of past returns. You want to know what the historical probability of observing a return between 10% and 20% has been over your sample. How would you proceed?

A: Count how many returns are between 10% and 20% in your sample and divide this figure by the total amount of returns there are in your sample.

D: By doing this computation, you assess the relative frequency of observing a return between 10% and 20% in your sample. This relative frequency is also called *historical probability* and gives information about the chance of observing a return between 10% and 20%.
