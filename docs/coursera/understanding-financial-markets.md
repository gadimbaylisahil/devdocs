### Common Mistakes

- Not treating currency as a separate asset
- Mixing up corporation names that are similar -- such as parent company. E.g, Mitsubishi vs Mitsubishi Motors

Measuring cheapness/value/price of the index is done with P/E ratio. Price/Earnings of the company. Thus, the index may actually be "cheap" while increasing.

### Conclusions

- Select the firm carefully based on correct name and treat the currency it is quoted in as a separete investment decision
- A bottom in the market may actually be more expensieve than a peak or vice versa
